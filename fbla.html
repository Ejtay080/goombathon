            <h1 id="#fbla">What is FBLA?</h1>
            <p>FBLA is the high school division of Future Business Leaders of America-Phi Beta Lambda, Inc. FBLA helps high school students prepare for careers in business through academic competitions (FBLA Competitive Events), leadership development, and educational programs.
            </p>
            <h1 id="#goal">What is the goal of FBLA?</h1>
            <p>They are organizations that are integrated into Career and Technical Education to help engage students in leadership skill building activities. West-MEC is proud to support all Career and Technical Student Organizations (CTSOs) throughout our Member School Districts.</p>
            <h1 id="#officers">FBLA Officers</h1>
            <p>FBLA Officers are the mind inside FBLA Coding. We have meetings every Wednesday, allowing for us to talk about possible summer trips, fundraisers, upcoming events, new info on recent news, etc. We make decisions, for the better of the group.</p>
            <h3>Here are all the FBLA officers and their positions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><figure>
                    <img src="images/" alt="Hailey Moya - FBLA President">
                    <figcaption>Hailey Moya - FBLA President</figcaption>
                </figure></li>
            </ul>
            <h1 id="#fundraising">FBLA Fundraising</h1>
            <p>Fundraisers are extremely benefical, and required for FBLA. They help us pay for FBLA trips, specifically people who can't afford to go. Everyone is an active participant of fundraising in FBLA. So far, we have 2 current fundraisers.</p>
            <h3>Sonic Drive</h3>
            <p>Fundraisers allows us to easily give our peers participation in FBLA by giving them items to sell, like the Sonic Drive. Everyone in FBLA recieves 4 Sonic Coupon Cards, each for 5$. Our goal is to sell all of these as quickly as possible, that way we can plan more fundraisers, trips, etc.</p>
            <h3>Shoe Drive</h3>
            <p>The Shoes Drive is a great fundraiser, because it doesn't matter how much shoes we collect as long as we reach the quota of 2500 shoes. This allows peers to ask friends, family, and relatives, to empty their closet of shoes they don't need, or are ripped. We give those shoes to a middleman who delivers those shoes to people more unfortunate than us in Haiti, who don't even have shoes. It's for a good cause, we make money for other student's trips, helps us grow as a CTSO, and it gets rid of your old shoes! It's a win-win-win-win!</p>
